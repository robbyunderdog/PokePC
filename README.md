# PokePC

A open-source application to search, store, and scan Pokemon TCG cards. 





## Features

- Card database, allowing the cataloging of all your Pokemon cards.
- Search feature, utilizing pre-cached card databases and Pokemon TCG API to fill the gaps.
- Deck Creator, create all the decks you can imagine, and allow "checking out" cards from your collection so you always know where your cards are located.
- Price information is included, using TCGPlayer's api information so you can keep track of your collection's value.

## FAQ

#### Will (insert moderation feature here) ever come to PokePC?

Most probably, it is a slow process but we are slowly adding everything someone might need for their collection.

#### Is this based on ManaBox?

Yes! I love ManaBox for all my Magic needs, but was irritated that there was not a Pokemon equivalent.
